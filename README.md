# StudentRegistration
### Overview
Welcome to the Student Course Management System repository! This Scala-based console application provides a simple system for managing student and course information. The program allows users to perform various operations, including inserting new students, adding new courses, associating courses with students, and searching for specific student or course details.

### Features
- Insert Students: Add new students to the system, ensuring that duplicate entries are not allowed based on student ID.
- Add Courses: Include new courses in the system, preventing the addition of courses with the same course number.
- Associate Courses with Students: Assign courses to specific students, allowing for grade entry for each course.
- Search for Students and Courses: Look up detailed information about a particular student or course.
- Termination: Exit the program cleanly with the "Exit" command.
